## Project 3 Report


### 1. Basic information
 - Team #: Dongjue Zu
 - Github Repo Link: https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs222p-winter22-BrandonZu
 - Student 1 UCI NetID: 3256 9266
 - Student 1 Name: Dongjue Zu


### 2. Meta-data page in an index file
- Show your meta-data page of an index design if you have any. 

There is one hidden page, which is the first page, in each index file.
This hidden page contains three counters, i.e. ixReadPageCounter, ixWritePageCounter, ixAppendPageCounter, and the page number of the root page. \
The format is as below:

| ixReadPageCounter | ixWritePageCounter | ixAppendPageCounter | RootPagePointer |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 4 bytes           | 4 bytes            | 4 bytes             | 4 bytes         |

### 3. Index Entry Format
- Show your index entry design (structure). 

- entries on internal nodes:  

| Key     | RID page num | RID slot num | Child Page Pointer |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------------|
| ? bytes | 4 bytes      | 2 bytes      |  4 bytes           |


- entries on leaf nodes:

| Key     | RID page num | RID slot num |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| ? bytes | 4 bytes      | 2 bytes      |

### 4. Page Format
- Show your internal-page (non-leaf node) design.



- Show your leaf-page (leaf node) design.



### 5. Describe the following operation logic.
- Split



- Rotation (if applicable)



- Merge/non-lazy deletion (if applicable)



- Duplicate key span in a page



- Duplicate key span multiple pages (if applicable)



### 6. Implementation Detail
- Have you added your own module or source file (.cc or .h)? 
  Clearly list the changes on files and CMakeLists.txt, if any.

/src/ix/IXFileHandle.cc
/src/ix/IXPageHandle.cc
/src/ix/IndexPageHandle.cc
/src/ix/LeafPageHandle.cc
/src/ix/IXScanIterator.cc

- Other implementation details:



### 7. Member contribution (for team of two)
- Explain how you distribute the workload in team.

Did all the work on my own.

### 8. Other (optional)
- Freely use this section to tell us about things that are related to the project 3, but not related to the other sections (optional)

I think the workload is too heavy for one person. I spent at least 60 hours coding in CLion, based on the statistic generated by a time management plugin, let alone the design process. \
The total time I spent on this project may add up to 70 hours. This is too much for one person to finish the project. I have to stay up late many times.

- Feedback on the project to help improve the project. (optional)

Could give more instructions on the design. For example, declare a pageHandle.
